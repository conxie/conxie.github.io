### hello!

I am a 4th year undergraduate pursuing a B.S. in Data Science & Cognitive Science at UC San Diego. I am currently working with [Dr. Anastasia Kiyonaga](https://www.kiyonagalab.org/pi-anastasia-kiyonaga) and [Dr. Tim Brady](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/people.html) on my independent honors thesis on the flexibility of pupillary signals under different working memory task strategies. In the past, I had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Armin Schwartzman](https://schwartzman.scholar.st) on [Exploring Working Memory Task Predictability using fMRI Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Alh3EjBe8erQRdZTWuVt4Q8l2W-dl-4U/view).

Outside of research, I enjoy traveling with friends‚úàÔ∏è, finding the best matcha in townüçµ, and I am currently training for a half marathonüèÉ
